	<p>These flowers are stunning. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, fragrances and colors. They are categorized into various species.</p>
      	<p>Lilies can be given for so many different occasions.</p>
	<p>They can be grown from bulbs or seeds. Growing them by bulb is the preferred method because growing them by seed take longer for the plants
to grow.</p> 
        <p>It can take anywhere from 5 to 6 years for a Lily plant to grow and flower when culturing them by seed.</p>
