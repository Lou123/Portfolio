        <h2>How HTML 5 Technology Influenced Me</h2>
        <p>I always knew about HTML and its various levels throughout the years, but discovered the newest level, HTML5, while working with a new equipment purchased at work. It is called BrightSign. The BrightSign unit is a small box which hooks up to a monitor to present looping images and videos. It was originally purchased to assist the company with presenting safety tips and training information within the company. There are currently five units throuhgout company and I am responsible for generating and publishing the content into all units.</p> 
        <p>Without any prior knowledge or training on what the units were capable of doing, I dived right into learining how they worked. With some research, and the help receieved from the Information Technology department in wiring them, I discovered its capabilities by conducting some skills developed through my many years experience using various software programs and the free, recorded webinars and resources on the BrightSign website.</p>
        <p>This is when I discovered HTML had evolved into an even greater state, HTML5. With that, I felt a need to understand more in order make the BrightSign unit work at its capacity. So, I set myself out to do a little internet research on HTML5, CSS, and some Java Script. It was too much Greek for me, but I continued to press on.</p>
        <p>After some time, I felt I really needed to invest in some formal training in order to grasp the concepts. I came across an opportunity to apply for a scholarship offerred by the company's insurance pool.</p> 
        <p>I drafted my story as the foundation in applying for the scholarship, was endorsed by the company's Operations Manager, and awarded the scholarship. I base my search for knowledge according to Confucious, the Ancient Chinese Philosopher who was known for quoting the following; 
          <q>I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.</q></p>

        <p>The next adventure will be to explore geofencing using the BrightSign units. It is the process of inputting gps concordance into the program which talks to the units, in order to prompt it to present content within a set radius and deliver appropriate messages at the right time and place. Testing will have have to take place. I'm sure it will be challenging and exciting when it happens, as it will open up new ways to promote public awareness about our transit system and what it offers.</p>

        <p>Above is an example of a GPS receiver that hooks up to a BrightSign unit for Geofencing.</p>
        <p>Below are pictures of monitors installed throughout the organization. As you can see, contents loop througout on a daily. The program used to control the contents and publishing to these monitors, is installed on my desktop. The program is called "BrightAuthor".
        <p>The monitor below is configured and hardwired to the Administrative BrightSign unit located away from my area of the building. An extra monitor was installed in order to visibly site publishing without having to leave my desk. You can have up to two monitors per unit.</p>

        <img src="images/monitor-by-my-desk1.jpg" class="float_left" alt="monitor" title="2nd monitor attached to Admin's BrightSign unit">
        <p>Below is the monitor located in the Operator's dayroom near the Dispatch window. It receives the same content as the others. If you look closely at the contents here; the lower, left zone shows a sattelite view of the weather. This is done by inputing the rss feed from a website called <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" target="_blank"> Weather Underground.</a> Hopefully I will understand the workings of the site so I can remove advertisement from the feed and use the program to collapse the height and or learn to incorporate a widget using BrightAuthor.</p>
