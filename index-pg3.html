      <h2>Repurposing</h2>
        <p>Lourdes Shuart has been repurposing items for quite some time. Back in the day, her dad was the one to inspire her. He truly believed that "one person's junk, was another person's treasure".  Her father was always trying to repurpose and use an old things to create new things.</p>
        <p>Many times Lourdes believed her father was a little out there, but after many years, Lourdes realized her father was actually a survivor and he was only trying to make ends meet during his time. The act of repurposing, was his means to supplement his income.</p> 
        <p>During the early 60s and 70s, he was providing for a very young family, and he ceased every opportunity to make a little money by accumulating milk and coca-cola-deposit bottles in order to recouperate the money needed to help his young family get some basic needs.</p> 
        <p>Deposit bottles are still around today, but are only recognized in certain states, and far less value than what he was reimbursed for back then. She even remembers times when her Dad used to pick up discarded TV and Radios in order to salvage the triad tubes, capacitors, and resistors that were still in working order. He used the good components to repair other TVs and Radios in order to make a few bucks. He was a TV and Radio Repairman on the side. Her father even purchased an abandoned home from the City of New York. Flipped the home by reconstructing it internally, and made it livable again. Lourdes lived in the home until she graduated from high school and moved away.</p>

      <p>Lourdes' had explored repurposing many times. Pictured above shows party favors for pinning guests at an engagement party. She made them from from cork plugs she saved. She got the idea from Pinterest.</p>

    <p>Although Repurposing is an old concept, it has evolved in many ways. This is especially true for those with an art driven imagination.</p>
    <p>If you have a really artistic ability, and are used to letting your imagination run wild, you can possibly go into business for yourself as an event planner/coordinator and incorporate various, inexpensive ways to decorate your venues, such as the wonderful little items shown below for table setting/decor. These items don't cost much and can easily look striking using some spray painting skills! This idea was also found on Pinterest. Check out the link below!!!</p>

      <p>As you recall from the previous page, Lourdes is extremely excited about the fall season.  While working for Island Transit she has had the opportunity to participate and represent the company in the "Scarecrow Corridor", an annual, Chamber-sponsored event. The Scarecrow Corridor is sponsored by the Central Whidbey Chamber and awards are given every year. Checkout the link below named: "Scarecrow". Lourdes and her "Repurposing Partners in crime" were able to walk away several times with various awards. Pictured below, are just a couple of the Scarecrows assembled.</p>

        </ul>
       <img src="images/Sea-Captain-closeup.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>This particular scarecrow was the first of its kind.  Lourdes and her group installed a solar panel which was attached to the the treasure chest which is picture below. The solar panel worked to illuminate the treasure chest inside and light up the Captains Lantern.  The solar panel was derived from solar panels that were once used to illuminate bus sheters. Virtually all the scarecrow and it components were used with repurposed material.</p>

       <img src="images/Treasure-chest.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>The treasure chest is having a solar panel installed on the back side, to give off special light effects during the evening hours.</p>

       <img src="images/Spongebob.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>Spongebob was another hit with the children.  He too was made with repurposed material.  The outfit was old unservicable uniforms, and his body was made from foam packaging materials from big equipment purchases. It was spray painted, the eyes were made of plastic bowls, and his teeth were actually plastic dental floss boxes! A great idea suggested by no other than a Dental Hygenist!!! Go figure. Spongebob was such a hit, that a co-worker of hers even asked if the scarecrow was available for him to place in his front yard to welcome his returning from the Army.  His son grew up watching Spongebob and he thought it would be fun to place in the front yard of his home for old times sake.</p>

       <img src="images/Jellyfish.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>The jellyfish were made from bright, pink bowls and old christmas lights attached from the inside so that they too may be lit during evening hours.</p>

        <img src="images/Fair-Parade.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>Parades were another way Lourdes used repurposed material. She save many items throughout the year to use for projects. She managed to take repurposing to another level, especially since the project did not have a budget to work with. If you look closely at the ferris wheel on the bus, the riding capsules were made out of plastic water bottles. They were painted and beads were glued to them to make them look vibrantly colored from afar. The Ferris wheel itself was used for anything to a jeopardy board game for a National Night Out event, to a helm for the Sea Captain, shown in a previous image above.</p>

        <img src="images/Queen-of-Parades.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width="260" height="145">
      <p>The crown on the top of this bus was a challenge. Every year Oak Harbor kicks off the year with the Holland Happening Parade. This particular year Lourdes wanted to incorporate the theme with the bus, but thought there were no takers.  She thought if she could only crown the bus, it would be awesome.  One of her co-workers encouraged to run with the idea and she did. The crown is made from a very thick packaging/cardboard material. It was painted and reinforced with pvc piping. The PVC idea came from another co-worker who had been working alongside her for a few years on several parade events. Some items float items were purchased from the website linked above. Even more dynamic, was the idea of fabricating the platform for the bus float itself. Check out pictures below on the parade events she participated in; all while using repurposed materials.</p>

      <p>The first photo shows a dutch shoe made from a large plastic barrel. Lourdes thought maybe she can make a giant shoe to look like a dutch wooden shoe. This took a lot of well though out planning.  She even made a mock-up, using a small plastic water bottle before attempting to construct it. In the second photo, if you look closely you can see the shoe is yellow and the bus' siding had a cape-like, royal look to it. A roll of cardboard which was once used for a huge landscaping project was used to create the cape. The picture on the right, is the bus decorated for the Island County Fair, which is held every year at the county Fairgrounds.  Lourdes also used many repurposed items to create the scene on the platform. The facade also was of a cardboard material and if you look closely you will note the ferris wheel was the same one used in previous parade pictures, only it was painted and decorated differently.</p>
