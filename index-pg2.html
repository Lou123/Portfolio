        <h2>A Little About Lourdes</h2>
        <p> Lourdes Shuart has over 25 years of work experience. Her work experience began in the United States Navy between 1980-1990, where she was just scratching the surface of computers and what they can do. While on active duty, Lourdes was able to gain experience operating big-frame, IBM computers and varied technical/customized equipment. In the early 1990s she entered the civilian sector in search of a job involving customer service and the office environment. She landed on a job as a Receptionist with the City of Burlington and worked there a little over six years. During that time, she was promoted to an Accounting Technician where she was able to grasp basic accounting techniques and principles using customized/municipal software programs.</p> 
        <p>After some time, Lourdes desired to expand her knowledge working with office computers, and sought an ATA degree in Office and Business Technology at Skagit Valley College. She emphasized her studies in computer software by attaining a certificate as a Microcomputer Specialist.</p> 
        <p>While searching for a local job and going to school, Lourdes managed to work part-time as a Bookkeeper for the community pool and then as a Domestic Violence Counselor. Both of these positions were short lived since Lourdes wanted to explore job opportunities within the transportation field and landed on a job as an Administrative Assistant with Island Transit in Coupeville, Washington. She quickly adapted because of her previous work experience and knowledge in accounting.</p> Within four years, she was transferred to the Operations department to assist the Operations Manager with database management and the Commercial Drivers License program. Her most recent accomplishment has been learning to operate the BrightSign units purchased during the newly built Island Transit facilities. Her next project is to test the BrightSign's Geofencing capabilities and incorporate them into the Island Transit buses. According to Jeff Hastings, BrightSign, CEO regarding geofencing, <q> The increased effectiveness of messages and signage that employ geofencing and geo-location features are driving the development of software and player firmware that support this marketing initiative.</q></p>
        <p>Delivering a more relevant and targeted message to your audience spells success.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Many businesses have experienced click-through rates on geofencing campaigns that are as much as 70% higher than standard ads.
